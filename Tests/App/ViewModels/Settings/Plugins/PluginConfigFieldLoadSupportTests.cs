// Child/array rows are built on first access rather than in the constructor. That is what lets the whole
// plugin list be constructed without paying for every plugin's config tree -- the page only ever shows
// one plugin's form, and building the rest was the bulk of its first-open cost. Lives in its own file
// because PluginConfigFieldViewModelTests had crossed the repo's per-file line limit, matching how the
// production side split its own load logic into PluginConfigFieldLoadSupport.
