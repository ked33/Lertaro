# Settings Reference

Lertaro provides a comprehensive and granular suite of customization options. Whether you want to fine-tune search bar pixel dimensions, customize global hotkeys, adjust drive indexing schedules, or manage third-party plugins and workspaces, everything can be configured in the Settings Center.

## 1. Window Features & Navigation

- **Resizable & Maximize Support**: The Settings window supports smooth border resizing, titlebar double-click maximizing, and persistent size memory across sessions.
- **Global Settings Search**: A search bar sits in the upper right corner of the Settings titlebar. Powered by Lertaro's fzf fuzzy matching engine, it searches across all sections (including plugin settings and actions). Selecting a result jumps straight to that setting item and highlights it with a temporary flashing border.
- **Scrollable Tab Bars**: In sections containing multiple nested sub-tabs (such as General, Hotkeys, Indexing), overflow navigation arrows appear on either side to ensure all tabs remain accessible across all UI languages.

## 2. Settings Sections Overview
