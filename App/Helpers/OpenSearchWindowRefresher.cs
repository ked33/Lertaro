// (QuickSearchWindowShowSupport.ShowWindow), and the result list only reflects whatever those
// settings said at dispatch time. Both stay stale when the user edits them in Settings while the
// window is already open. This pushes the saved data into those windows immediately, so a user
// action in Settings is reflected in every open search surface without waiting for the next
// show or keystroke -- settings saves are rare, so the one extra re-run per open window costs
// nothing noticeable.
