/// Explorer has no public API for its tabs, and the two ways around that are not equal. The one used here
/// is UI Automation: the accessibility API Explorer itself implements and keeps working, because
/// screen readers depend on it. The one it replaces was an undocumented <c>WM_COMMAND 0xA21B</c> posted at
/// the tab window, which is a message number copied out of someone else's reverse engineering and is free
/// to change or be ignored in any Windows update.
///
/// The button is identified by its AutomationId, never by its name: the name is localized ("New tab",
/// "添加新标签页", ...), while the AutomationId is <c>AddButton</c> in the tab strip's WinUI TabView on
/// every locale. Every step is best-effort -- a build without tabs, a hung Explorer, or a future layout
/// that renames the button all end in "no tab was created" and the caller opens the folder the normal way
/// instead.
