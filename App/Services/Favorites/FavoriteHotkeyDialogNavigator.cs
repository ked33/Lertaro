///
/// Why a dialog needs its own route: a browser/Office/Notepad "Save As" dialog is a <c>#32770</c> common
/// dialog owned by that application's process, so no inline-search adapter recognizes it -- they all match
/// a file manager's own window class -- and the file-manager route has nothing it could drive. What can
/// drive it is the app's existing <c>IFileDialogAdapter</c> set, the same adapters inline search uses to
/// put a picked result into a dialog, reached through the same <c>IpcMessageId.NavigateDialog</c> command,
/// whose Hook-side handler resolves the adapter and calls <c>NavigateTo</c> there.
