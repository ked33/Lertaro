// Opus through a separate process (up to a multi-second wait on the hook thread) and re-scraping the
// file-display windows, and the window is made visible repeatedly while the user works -- measured at
// one request every ~5s, each of which froze the UI long enough that the user could not click. The
// opened folders cannot meaningfully change within one showing anyway.
