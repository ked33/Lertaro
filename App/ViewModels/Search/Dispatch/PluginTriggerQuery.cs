/// Removes a leading trigger word from the text that gets searched against file and application names --

/// trigger inside every result row it dragged in.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every word the search box can answer to is inventoried here from live plugin state, so the host keeps no
/// copy of any of them: an instant provider's configured word
/// (<see cref="IInstantResultProvider.QueryTriggerKeywords"/>, read per call so a Settings change takes
/// effect on the next keystroke), a search action's own <em>Keywords</em> ("mkdir", "touch", "cmd"), a file
/// filter's scope keyword, and a per-type trigger character. The last two are collected for the collision
/// report only (<see cref="PluginTriggerCollisionReport"/>, which owns the "who else owns this word" rule
/// and the Settings warning) -- their own resolvers strip them, so stripping them here would strip twice.
///
/// The inventory is <em>per window</em>. A word is only stripped where its owner can actually be offered:
/// an action whose <c>IsVisibleInSearch</c> refuses this window contributes nothing (CoreExtensions'
/// mkdir/touch/cmd are inline-only, so in the quick window they used to take "mkdir" out of a file search
/// for a row that window never shows). <see cref="Collect()"/> is the window-agnostic inventory, which is
/// what the Settings warning needs -- a collision is worth naming whether or not the current window offers
/// both features.
///
/// The comparison itself is <see cref="TriggerWord"/>, shared with <see cref="KeywordMatcher"/> and
/// <see cref="FileFilterScopeResolver"/> and with every provider that owns a word, because the host and the
/// owner have to agree: a word the host strips but its owner does not recognise leaves the user with
/// neither the feature nor their search text.
///
/// Same shape as <see cref="FileFilterScopeResolver"/>: a thin collector over PluginManager and a pure
/// <see cref="Match"/> holding the activation rules, so the rules are testable without the registry.
///
/// Providers still receive the untouched box text (see SearchExecutionEngine's instantQuery, and the raw
/// query the full window hands its content provider), because the owner of a word has to keep recognising
/// it; what this changes is only what the OTHER results are matched and highlighted against. The price,
/// paid deliberately: a first token that happens to be a command word stops being searchable as text --
/// which is why nothing is stripped unless a term follows it.
