// line limit; everything here operates on state UsnIndexer owns and is called from UsnMonitor (advance)
// and SearchEngine's idle trim (persist).
//
// Without the persist half, a USN drive's cache file and watermark sat frozen at the last cold-start
// catch-up for the entire session: every restart replayed the whole journal range since then (bounded by
// the volume's own journal window, 32 MB by default on a system drive that can wrap in hours), and any
// batch that failed to land stayed invisible until one of those restarts.
