// Owns one drive's Snapshot + DeltaOverlay pair and the concurrency model the prototype never needed
// (a single-threaded benchmark has no readers to race). Snapshot itself is immutable once mapped, so
// searches never need to block each other -- only DeltaOverlay's mutable dictionaries/lists need
// protection, and Compact() needs a consistent view to merge from. Readers take the read lock (many
// concurrent searches); a USN/watcher batch or a Compact()/SwapSnapshot() call takes the write lock.
//
// Compact() deliberately holds the write lock for its ENTIRE duration (merge + file write + reopen),
// not just the final swap -- DeltaOverlay's dictionaries aren't safe to iterate while a concurrent
// Mutate() call could be appending to them, so there is no cheaper correct alternative without a
// versioned/copy-on-write overlay. This blocks searches for the duration of one compaction (bounded,
// background/idle-triggered), matching this codebase's existing tolerance for blocking full-process
// GC.Collect calls during rebuilds. Shrinking this window is a valid future optimization, not a
// correctness requirement.
