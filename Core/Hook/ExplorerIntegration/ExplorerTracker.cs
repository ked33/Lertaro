    /// the breadcrumb is built later, so a modern dialog is claimed by the classic adapter until it settles.

    /// measured on live Rimage dialogs, the tracker held an adapter it should not have for the whole life of
    /// the card without ever taking the claim branch, and only a focus change -- the next activation, hence
    /// the next RefreshActiveWindowAdapters -- ended it.

    /// Off the calling thread and speculative-tight on the read: callers include the IPC mirror thread and
