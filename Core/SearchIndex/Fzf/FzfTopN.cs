// Keeps the `capacity` best (smallest sort key) of an unbounded stream of ranks.
//
// Buffered rather than kept exactly at capacity: the buffer grows with actual matches up to twice what
// is retained, and is trimmed back down to the best half only when it fills. Between trims an incoming
// rank is one compare against the threshold from the last trim, and a trim costs O(capacity) once per
// capacity accepted ranks, so the amortised cost per rank is constant. Growing from a modest initial
// buffer matters when an unbounded full-window query runs across several indexes concurrently: each
// index used to reserve arrays for every row before knowing how many names actually matched.
//
// It used to hold exactly capacity entries and, whenever one was displaced, rescan all of them to find
// the new worst -- O(capacity) per accepted rank rather than per capacity of them. A broad query
// accepts a large fraction of what it scans, so this was the dominant cost of the whole search: a
// single-character query over 400k rows spent more time here than in matching.
//
// Ties in sort key are common (every row of one unique name shares its key), and which of them survives
// at the capacity boundary is arbitrary -- as it was before. It does not reach the user: callers keep a
// capacity many times the number of results they display, and Finish sorts by EntryIndex within a key.
