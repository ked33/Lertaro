/// The two things it exists to get right, both of which were wrong when this was a pair of fields:
///
/// A search that is still running is not idle, however long ago it started. Activity used to be stamped
/// only when a search BEGAN, and a search blocks until it finishes, so a ten-second query looked idle
/// three seconds in. The trimmer fired into the middle of it, tried to collect what that search was
/// actively using, got nothing, and consumed the one-shot arming on the way past -- so once the search
/// really did finish there was nothing left to ask again, and the process sat on its peak. A short query
/// finished inside those three seconds and trimmed correctly, which is why this presented as "short
/// searches give the memory back and long ones never do".
///
/// And the trim is one-shot per burst of activity: there is no point stopping the world again when
/// nothing has happened since the last time.
